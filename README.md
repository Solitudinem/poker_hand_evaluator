Hello.
Let me to intruduce you a poker hand evaluator for seven cards. Evaluator works with two type of cards:
  own cards - cards, that belong to virtual player;
  table cards - cards,  that were dealt on the table.
Every class has virtual destructor in case you want to inherit it. There is more informations about percise work of code in comments.
I hope this application or part of code of it will be usefull for you.
With all respect,
Solitudinem
